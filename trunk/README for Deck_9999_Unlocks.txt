DESCRIPTION
-----------

Deck_9999_Unlocks1.wad is a universal unlocker that enables unlockable cards for the following mods:
* DOTP 2013 Community DLC MOD SVN - r27 (and following, until a new deck is added)
* Riiak Shi Nal's DotP 2013 DLC - v1.2 (and following, until a new deck is added)
* Thefiremind's DotP2013 DLC - v4b (and following, until the 21th deck is added)

Deck_9999_Unlocks2.wad does the same thing, but it follows maginater5000's example and allows to unlock everything from the start on Skidrow version.

HOW TO USE IT
-------------
Just delete other eventual WAD files made for the same purpose, and put either Unlocks1 or Unlocks2 (NOT BOTH) in your DotP2013 directory.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
The game will not remember how you customized the mods' decks between program runs. This bug still remains mysterious and unsolved.
